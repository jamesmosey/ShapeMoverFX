Learning GUI's with JavaFX:

In this application there is 2 scenes, both with the same purpose.
The first scene allows the user to move a circle around the interface by using buttons to increment movements along the X and Y axes.
The second scene operates using the same methods but a square is being moved instead of a circle.
A button in the top left allows switching between the scenes.
The stylesheet is linked to both FXML files so that styles stay consistent across both scenes. 

- Used Scene Builder to edit FXML files
- Linked stylesheet to allow for CSS styling of the GUI
- Controller class created to handle certain methods
